# trigger-based-event-system
A collection of scripts implementing the trigger based event system I designed for Unity.

## Folder contents
* `Events` holds scripts responsible for the events system itself. Here lies the code for the box collider trigger system
and different events that can arise from interractions.
* `Torch` holds scripts for the torch object from the game, such as the flickering mechaninc. It relies on the event system.
* `FPSModules` holds parts of the system that are to be placed on the player character.
